The yellow-faced honeyeater (Caligavis chrysops) is a bird in the honeyeater family found in eastern and south eastern Australia. It has yellow stripes on the sides of its head and a loud clear call. It inhabits open forests and woodlands at all altitudes. It is short-billed for a honeyeater and feeds on insects and spiders, as well as the nectar and pollen of flowers such as Banksia. It catches insects in flight and from plant foliage. While some yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, large numbers migrate to southern Queensland for the winter, returning in July and August to breed in New South Wales and Victoria. Pairs lay two or three eggs in a delicate cup nest. While breeding success can be low, pairs nest several times during the breeding season. Their woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land clearing, grazing, and weeds, although this bird is common and widespread and considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to be of least concern for conservation.
